# CASE 2

There could be various reasons for this type of issue so we need to assist our client while our teams (Frontend, Backend, and QA) work to find and solve this problem.

### Check the authentication

I would first verify the authentication process is working correctly, checking the validation for the username and password. So I can ensure that the credentials are matching with the stored data.

### Check the "Forgot password?" feature

I would check the code and logic behind the feature to confirm its functionality. We need to validate if it's sending the recovery emails, if its content is correct, and if the recovery link is functional.

##### Spam filters

Advise the client to check their spam or trash folder for the recovery email. Additionally, check if the client's email provider is blocking emails from your application.

##### Check the configuration of the email sending

Have our backend team check the email-sending functionality and configuration. Ensure that emails are being sent correctly from your system and are not being blocked by spam filters.

##### Tests the feature

With the QA Team, we need to perform some tests to guarantee that the emails are being sent and test with multiple email addresses to confirm if the issue is specific to the client's email provider.

##### Error handling

I would suggest that our teams improve our error-handling mechanisms to provide clear and informative error messages to users during login and password recovery attempts.

### Assist the client

While our backend and QA teams are working on the solution, I'd offer manual assistance to the client by generating a temporary password and guiding them through the password reset process, ensuring they can access their account. Also, I would keep them updated about our progress and notify them once the problem is resolved.
