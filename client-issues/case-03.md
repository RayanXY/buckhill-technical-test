# CASE 3

Payment issues can be frustrating for both the customer and the business. First, we need to keep in contact with the client and offer assistance in completing his payment successfully. We will need the Backend, QA, and Customer Support teams to ensure we will solve the issue as fast as possible.

### Reach out to the client to gather more details

Let's have Customer Support talk to the client to gather more specific details about the freezing issue, such as the exact point in the process where the screen freezes, and information about the browser and device he's using.

##### A workaround

We need to provide a temporary solution to the client, such as suggesting an alternative browser advising him to try the payment process on a different device, and even offering an alternative way for him to pay

### Check the payment integration

Let's examine if our code is properly integrated with the payment service provider, check if the APIs are being called, and respond appropriately.

### Check the payment methods

We need also to verify if all the available payment methods are configured and are compatible with our system. Review the latest changes and look for recent updates that might have affected the payment processing.

##### Test the payment methods

Test all payment methods individually so we can identify if the issue is particular to a method. We can also ensure that each method is working as expected. We should also test on various browsers and devices to determine if the freezing issue is browser or device-specific.

##### Test performance

We need to assess the overall system's performance and check for any latency issues during the payment process. Monitor server response times and data processing speed.

### Optimize the code

We have to make necessary updates to the code based on findings and optimizations to ensure smooth payment processing. Address any performance bottlenecks that might be causing the freezing. 

### More tests and validation

More tests are necessary with the payment process to ensure the freezing issue is resolved and that customers can complete payments without any disruptions.
